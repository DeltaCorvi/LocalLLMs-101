Misty has got to be one of my favorite programs for having fun with LL miss. The beauty of this application is it provides an easy to use GUI that allows me to interact with multiple LLMS with *exactly* the same prompts and *exactly* the same attachments at *exactly* the same time. How cool is that?

But wait, there's more!

Misty can pull models of various kinds from both the Olama repo and from hugging face. On top of that, it can also utilize API keys for 3rd party, so-called "frontier" AI providers like OpenAI for ChatGPT, Anthropic for Claude, etc.
